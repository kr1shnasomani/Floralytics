This CNN-based flower classification model processes the Flowers Recognition dataset, utilizing image augmentation and deep learning to classify Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip. The model achieves 97% accuracy with optimized convolutional layers ensuring robust feature extraction and high-performance classification.

## Execution Guide:
1. Run the following command line in the terminal:
   ```
   pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn opencv-python pillow
   ```

2. Download the dataset (link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition)

3. Copy and paste the path of the images into the code

4. Upon running the code the model outputs its prediction
